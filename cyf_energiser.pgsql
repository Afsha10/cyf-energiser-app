    VALUES ('MentalExercise', 'Meditation', 'Mindfulness meditation has a number of positive health benefits not limited to the mental realm. It improves immune system function, qualitatively improves interpersonal relationships, and reduces stress and anxiety. Of course, there are strictly mental benefits as well--the vast majority of regular meditative practitioners have greater focus, concentration, and mindfulness than their counterparts. Meditating itself is relatively simple; all you have to do is find someplace quiet and relaxing, and dedicate 15 minutes or longer to freeing your mind of thoughts, deliberately letting each thought go until you achieve a state of pure mindfulness');

With a check-in question, the group shares something that describes their current status from a new perspective. The aim is to get the group on the same page before getting on with the task at hand.Ask questions that are easy to answer. Personal questions often work, as people get to talk about something they know well: themselves. This is my favorite site for practical tips for check-in questions.');
